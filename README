Repo for my Android "application" Data Settings

Data Settings is in fact not really an android application. It is just a shortcut to the right settings page to allow in the user to enable or disable the data and/or the 3G in two clicks.

The main issue is to support OS customizations, like HTC Sense or Samsung TouchWiz.

The aim of the project is not to create a widget, in order to differ from every all other widgets already in Google Play which are modifying APN and can make them not very usable.
