============

Repo for my Android "application" Data Settings

DataSetting is in fact not really an android application. It is just a shortcut to the right settings to allow in 2 click the user to enable or disable the data.

The main issue is to support every customizations of the OS, like HTC Sense or Samsung TouchWiz.

THe aim of the project is not to create a widget, in order to differ from every all other widgets already in Google Play which are modifying APN and can make them not very usable.
